I am an Application Specialist at Roche Diagnostics, where I work with customers doing both training and assisting with any issues on their instruments. I have picked up a basis in both Python and R in my free time, and my love for numbers is growing.  I hope to continue to learn more and find a role as a Data Scientist!
