<div id="tldr" class="section level1">
<h1>TL:DR</h1>
<p>Today I am going to dive into some real life data from the World Health Organization (WHO), exploring new and relapse cases of Tuberculosis. I clean up the data, and then make a few graphs to explore different variables.</p>
</div>
<div id="load-packages" class="section level1">
<h1>Load Packages</h1>
<p>Since I am going to use quite a few packages in the tidyverse I am going to load them all in at once instead of individually.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="load-in-data" class="section level1">
<h1>Load in Data</h1>
<p>We are using the WHO data set which contains tuberculosis (TB) cases broken down by year, this data set is contained in the Tidyr package, however its only recent up to 2014. For a little added fun I have downloaded the latest data from the WHO website, <a href="https://www.who.int/tb/country/data/download/en/">Found here</a>. For some added fun I have also included GDP per Capita data from World bank <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD">Found here</a></p>
<pre class="r"><code>who_raw &lt;-  read.csv(&quot;../../../static/data/TB_notifications_2020-02-11.csv&quot;)

#GPD file contains 4 rows of instrusctions above the actually data, we can tell
#read.csv to skip these using the skip command

</div>
<div id="transform" class="section level1">
<h1>Transform</h1>
<p>This data set is very ugly looking! The first 3 columns are all country Identifiers, with column four indicating the WHO region. This is redundant and can be dropped down to one Identifier and Region. As we can see there are quite a few Variable columns that are in fact values and not true Variables. When reading the data dictionary for this data set, WHO has changed their reporting over the years, so for our purposes we can strip a lot of the extra data out. Lets try and look at three types of TB, Extrapulmonary, Lab Diagnosed, and Clinician Diagnosed. As well as try and look at the breakdowns by Age and Sex of new and relapse case (post 2012) Lots of Cleaning to do, lets get to it!</p>

<h2>A different way to look</h2>
<p>Could there be any correlation between a countries population and the amount of TB cases? Maybe its just as simple as having more people means more people to get sick?

<p>Cases were steadily rising from 1980 to 1990, then suddenly feel off. Starting in the early 2010s there was a sharp increase and the amount of new and relapse cases just keep growing.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="next-steps" class="section level1">
<h1>Next Steps</h1>
<p>While no other country has the amount of cases that India does, the sudden spike in cases at adolescences asks the question do other countries follow this same trend? We can also see the sudden spike in the 2010s, again is this just based in India or do we see this trend in other countries. There is much more exploration we can do with this data set at a later time!</p>
