<p>Todays post is a lesson in Facets, as well as humility. The task this week was to replicate the graph in Chapter 8 of Tableau for Healthcare in R. The graph in question is called a Table Lens (This is the name the book uses, however I did have trouble finding this name in Google searches), it is a collection of charts with a common theme, this time looking at countries in various WHO regions and some statistics associated with mortality as well as health expenditure. I say this is a lesson in humiltiy as I have read through the excellent book <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/">R for Data Science</a>, and yet the idea of faceting a ggplot graph slipped my mind. This ended with hours of trying to find a package in R to line up graphs, and way more time then I care to admit spent on getting things prefect. I did find such a package called cowplots, which can be found <a href="https://wilkelab.org/cowplot/index.html">here</a>. While this is an excellent package, its use was unecessary and I reverted back to using the excellent facet feature of GGplot, which can be seen below! <img src="WHO_LIFE.png" /></p>
